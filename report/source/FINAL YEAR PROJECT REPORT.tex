\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\quad ABSTRACT}
The project focuses majorly on the design of the software development which will be used to screen resumes (Curriculum Vitae) for a particular job posting. A web application will encourage the job applicant candidates as well as the recruiters to use it for job applications and screening of resumes. Recruitment is a tedious process wherein the first task for any recruiter is to screen the resumes. The proposed web application is designed in such a way that job applicant as well as recruiters can use it with ease for applying for job openings and screening respectively. The recruiters from various companies can post the details of the job openings available in their respective companies. The interactive web application will allow the job applicants to submit their resume and apply for their job postings they may still be interested in. The resumes submitted by the candidates are then compared with the job profile requirement posted by the company recruiter. Scores can then be given to the resumes and they can be ranked from highest match to lowest match. This ranking is made visible only to the company recruiter who is interested to select the best candidates from a large pool of candidates.

Writing a resume is not a trivial task, especially when it comes to the right selection of keywords. People spend hours writing and formatting the perfect resume hoping it to be read by a talent acquisition professional and, eventually, help them land a job interview. Unfortunately, around 75\% of resumes submitted are never seen by a human eye.

Due to the high number of applicants and resumes submissions to job postings, manual resumes screening processes become tedious, ineffective and time consuming for talent acquisition professionals. Therefore, standardized automated screening methods are necessary to categorize qualified from unqualified candidates based on their background, education and professional experience faster, with more efficiency and more accurate results to streamline hiring processes.


\section{History of Resume Screening}
Resume Screening is the process of evaluating the 
candidates' resumes based on a specific requirement.
It is a process of searching for a perfect fit for the required 
role based on the candidate's qualifications like education, 
experience, skills, capabilities, and so on mentioned in their 
resumes.
\par
The qualities of the candidates should fit the requirement 
for selecting the candidate to enter the next stage of the 
interview.

\section{Objective}     % You can add any sections like that . 
The basic Job Hiring process consists of 5 steps in which 
resume screening is the first and most effective step to 
segregate the candidates who are fit for the required job role.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Basic Job Hiring Process.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Resume Screening consists of 4 basic steps:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Selecting the resumes with the required credentials, i.e., 
only the resumes matching the required job description,
will be considered.}
    \item {Select the resumes with the desired skills, i.e., only the 
candidates who mentioned the skills that match the job 
role will be considered.}
    \item {Selecting the resumes customized for the job, i.e., 
considering the resumes that accurately match the job 
role.}
    \item {Checking the applicant's information, i.e., scanning all 
the candidate's information and considering which 
matches the job profile properly.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 12 cm]{2.png}
\caption{ Steps involved in Resume Screening}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Some of the most common difficulties encountered 
during the resume screening process
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Time Consuming-When there are a lot of resumes, it 
becomes more difficult.}
    \item{Hiring Quality-When there is a bulk of resumes, the
hiring quality suffers.}
    \item{Hiring Biases-Recruiters may be biased in favor of 
certain prospects.
}
    \item{Recruiter Experience-If, the recruiter, is unfamiliar 
with all of the job-related abilities, the screening 
procedure may be inefficient.}
    \item{Recruiters Search-If, a suitable applicant is located, 
recruiters may halt the search and skip the rest of the 
stack.
}
    \item{Unnecessary recruiter allocation-Separate recruiters 
should be assigned to the resume screening process, 
wasting time and resources.}
\end{itemize}


\section{Problem Statement}
\subsubsection{Volume of resume:}
The number of resumes received by a company is one of the biggest challenges. On average, there are about 250 resumes received for an open position, and 88\% of them tend to be unqualified. It means the recruiter has to spend enough time to cut the clutter, and finalise the 12\% of candidates. This amounts to close to 23 hours on average. The usual solution to this problem is the Applicant Tracking System (ATS), a must-have software for screening resumes in a company.

\subsubsection{Hiring Criteria:}
Sometimes, companies can set criteria for their hires or a framework to get their hiring process done. Even in the initial part when screening of resumes is taking place, it can prevent good candidates from getting filtered out. It should make companies vigilant about the resume screening process. Also, there is a need for revisiting the screening process consistently to ensure that the worthy candidates get the opportunities to enter the next round.



\chapter{SYSTEM ANALYSIS} %use UPPER CASE letters
\section{Existing Systems}
There are several existing systems and methodologies of resume screening techniques that are widely used . Here are some notable techniques:

\subsection{ Manual Screening}Screening of resumes is done by some of the company's employees who are going to recruit, i.e., every resume is checked individually, and if the resume is fit for the required job description, then the resume will be selected. It might be done based on the capabilities they seek, the
candidates' work experience, or other factors that are relevant
to the job profile.

\subsection {Resume Evaluation System based on AI}A Resume Screening Software is created using artificial intelligence, text mining, and processing algorithms. These algorithms filter and rank resumes based on specific keywords to identify which job applications recruiters should consider further.


\subsection{Resume Sorting using Artificial Intelligence} A Database is created to store job applicants' resumes. This system is trained using Artificial Intelligence to recognize the words separately from a resume. Some important keywords that fit the job description, like skills, education qualification, and so on, are given to the system separately through some other files. The system is trained to scan the resumes and search for the separately given keywords. 

\subsection{Resume Sorting using ML} The system
starts by cleansing all the unimportant information in the
resumes, such as numbers, special characters, single-letter
words, etc. They are then placed in one data set where the
data is split into tokens using NLTK tokenizes.

\subsection{Resume Screening using Machine Learning} The screening process should begin with removing garbage terms. The remaining words are then screened, and skill points are granted. And the skill points will be assigned in the appropriate order. Finally, a graph will be displayed due to the skill points, allowing eligible
candidates for the job role to be selected.

\subsection{Resume Screening Using Deep Learning}The data set primarily has 2 columns in this project. They are Category and Resume. The category represents the fields like Java, Database,
Blockchain, and so on. We must allocate the resume into one of the categories by utilizing it as input.

\subsection{Resume Screening Using Python}It was created using the Deep Learning method and learns from its prior data. Using the specified categories and resumes, the screening process has begun. Each resume is taken in and screened, then used to create output for that specific resume. 


\section{Literature Review}

\par In the paper[1], Manual screening, it abstracting the file only in PDF 
format,so here there is no other options to add up the different kind 
of file formats which is named like docx, zip so on. Manual resume screening refers to the process of reviewing and evaluating job applicants' 
resumes or CVs by human recruiters or hiring managers. It is a crucial step in the recruitment and selection process that helps identify qualified candidates for a particular job position.
During manual resume screening, recruiters typically follow a set of predefined criteria or job requirements to assess each applicant's qualifications, skills, and experience. The process involves analyzing the content of the resume to determine whether the candidate possesses the necessary qualifications and potential to succeed in the role.
Here are some key steps involved in manual resume screening:
\newline
Resume Collection: Resumes are collected through various channels such as job boards, company websites, career fairs, or employee referrals.
\newline
Initial Review: Recruiters go through the received resumes and conduct an initial scan to eliminate any clearly unqualified applicants. This scan is usually based on basic criteria like education level, relevant work experience, and key skills mentioned in the job description.
\newline
Skill Assessment: Recruiters then evaluate the candidate's skills and qualifications relevant to the job requirements. They look for specific keywords or phrases related to the required technical or soft skills to assess the candidate's suitability for the role.
\newline
Work Experience Evaluation: Recruiters carefully examine the candidate's work experience section to evaluate the relevance and depth of their previous roles. They assess the duration, job titles, responsibilities, and accomplishments to determine if the candidate's experience aligns with the job requirements.
\newline
Education and Certifications: The educational background and any relevant certifications mentioned in the resume are reviewed to ensure they meet the minimum requirements specified for the position.
\newline
Additional Qualifications: Recruiters assess any additional qualifications, such as language proficiency, leadership experience, or industry-specific certifications, that may be required for the role.
\newline
Formatting and Presentation: The resume's overall formatting, organization, and readability are considered to gauge the candidate's attention to detail and communication skills. A well-structured and error-free resume often receives more favorable consideration.
\newline
Applicant Ranking: Based on the evaluation, recruiters rank or score the resumes to prioritize the most promising candidates. This ranking helps determine which candidates will proceed to the next stage of the hiring process, such as interviews or assessments.
\newline
It's important to note that manual resume screening can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of applications. To streamline the process, some organizations may use applicant tracking systems (ATS) or resume screening software to automate the initial screening and filter out resumes that don't meet certain criteria before manual review.
\newline
Manual resume screening plays a crucial role in identifying potential candidates for further evaluation, ensuring that only the most qualified individuals proceed in the hiring process.
The problem for the paper is that it is time consuming error ineffcient and having alot of pressure. The solution which is give into the paper is resume is checked by a hiring team which is only focusing for the resume checking by individually. The drawback for the paper is that due to many resumes and little time availability for procesing it is very diffliculty and many resumes can be rejected without given an proper attention to the profile.
\bigskip
\par In the paper[2], manual screening with the help of web application is an another type of screening process that is used to be assigned earlier. Manual screening of resumes with the help of the web involves using online platforms and resources to review and evaluate job applicants' resumes or CVs. Here's a brief overview of the process:
\newline
Resume Submission: Candidates submit their resumes or CVs through online platforms like job boards, company websites, or recruitment portals.
\newline
Resume Parsing: The submitted resumes are often processed through resume parsing software, which extracts relevant information and structures it into a standardized format. This helps to categorize and organize the resumes for easier review.
\newline
Online Search: Recruiters may conduct online searches to gather additional information about the candidates. They might search for the candidate's name, review their social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn), or explore professional networking sites to gain insights into their professional background and online presence.
\newline
Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): Many organizations utilize ATS software to manage the hiring process. Recruiters may use the ATS to filter resumes based on predefined criteria such as keywords, qualifications, or location. The system can narrow down the pool of applicants, making it more manageable for manual screening.
\newline
Review and Evaluation: Recruiters review the resumes manually, considering various aspects such as education, work experience, skills, achievements, and qualifications. They assess whether the candidate's background aligns with the job requirements and evaluate the overall quality and presentation of the resume.
\newline
Online Reference Checks: Recruiters may conduct online reference checks by reaching out to the provided references through email or professional networking platforms. They might inquire about the candidate's performance, skills, and work ethic to gather additional insights.
\newline
Communication: If recruiters find potential matches during the manual screening, they may reach out to the candidates via email or through the contact information provided in their resumes. This communication may involve requesting additional information, scheduling interviews, or inviting candidates for further assessments.
\newline
Shortlisting and Ranking: Recruiters rank or shortlist the candidates based on their evaluation. This ranking helps determine which candidates will proceed to the next stages of the hiring process, such as interviews or assessments.
\newline
By leveraging the web, recruiters can access a larger pool of candidates and gather more information to aid in the screening process. However, it's essential to handle the information obtained from online sources ethically and with respect for privacy regulations.
\newline
It's worth noting that while the web can assist in streamlining certain aspects of resume screening, the final evaluation and decision-making process usually relies on the judgment and expertise of human recruiters or hiring managers.
\newline
The problem which is observed in the paper is that it is time consuming, inefficient, error and having alot of pressure.
The resume is checked with the help of the web application.
The major drawback is that can be miss out some datas and can create a bug due to heavy traffic because it is overflowing over the internet.
\bigskip
\par In the paper[3] screening with automatic scoring is fully in the basic of calculating the score which the candidate has occured.
Resume screening with automatic scoring involves using software or algorithms to assess and score resumes based on predefined criteria. Here's a brief explanation of the process:
\newline
Resume Collection: Resumes are collected through various channels, such as online job portals, company websites, or recruitment platforms.
\newline
Resume Parsing: The collected resumes are processed using resume parsing software, which extracts relevant information and structures it into a standardized format. This helps in organizing the data for automated analysis.
\newline
Predefined Criteria: The hiring organization establishes predefined criteria or job requirements that the resumes will be evaluated against. These criteria may include qualifications, skills, experience, education, certifications, and other relevant factors.
\newline
Automated Analysis: The resume screening software or algorithm analyzes the resumes based on the predefined criteria. It scans the resume content, including the text and keywords, to identify matches or discrepancies with the job requirements.
\newline
Scoring System: The software assigns scores or rankings to the resumes based on the degree of alignment between the resume and the predefined criteria. Each criterion may have a different weight or importance, and the algorithm calculates an overall score based on these factors.
\newline
Elimination or Shortlisting: Resumes that do not meet the minimum scoring threshold or fail to fulfill essential criteria may be eliminated at this stage. On the other hand, resumes that receive high scores and meet the desired criteria may be shortlisted for further evaluation.
\newline
Human Review: After the automated scoring, the shortlisted resumes are usually reviewed manually by recruiters or hiring managers. They consider the automated scores as a reference but also take into account other subjective factors that may not be captured by the software, such as the quality of writing, unique accomplishments, or relevant contextual information.
\newline
Final Selection: The resumes that pass the automated scoring and subsequent manual review are considered for further stages of the hiring process, such as interviews, assessments, or background checks.
\newline
Automated scoring in resume screening aims to streamline the initial screening process by efficiently handling large volumes of resumes. It helps recruiters and hiring teams save time and focus on the most promising candidates. However, it's important to note that automated scoring is not a foolproof method and should be used as a tool to assist human decision-making rather than as a substitute for it.
\newline
The problem is that it is time consuming,formation of errors, inefficient, having a lot of pressure. The solution which is given for this paper is to analyzebased on education qualification. The drawback for this paper is that missing out skilled candidates.Those who are having skillful mind set for certain kind of specific tasks.
\bigskip
\par In the paper[4],Resume Screening with the help of cloud database 
here the paper is storing all kind of datas in to the cloud database.
Resume screening with the help of a cloud database involves utilizing cloud-based technologies and databases to store, access, and analyze resumes during the screening process. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:
\newline
Cloud Storage: Resumes are stored in a cloud-based database or storage system. This allows for easy and centralized access to resume data from anywhere with an internet connection. Resumes can be securely uploaded and stored in the cloud, eliminating the need for physical storage or local servers.
\newline
Resume Parsing and Data Extraction: When resumes are uploaded to the cloud database, resume parsing technology can be applied to extract relevant information from the resumes and structure it in a standardized format. This parsing process helps categorize and organize the resume data for efficient retrieval and analysis.
\newline
Data Indexing and Search: The cloud database indexes the parsed resume data, making it searchable. Recruiters or hiring managers can use search queries or filters to quickly retrieve resumes based on specific criteria such as skills, experience, education, or keywords related to the job requirements.
\newline
Automated Screening Algorithms: Resume screening algorithms can be implemented within the cloud database to automatically analyze and evaluate resumes based on predefined criteria. These algorithms can scan the parsed resume data and identify matches or discrepancies with the desired qualifications and skills. The screening algorithms may assign scores or rankings to the resumes based on the degree of alignment with the job requirements.
\newline
Collaboration and Accessibility: Cloud-based resume screening enables multiple recruiters or hiring team members to access and collaborate on the screening process simultaneously. They can review and provide feedback on resumes in real-time, share notes, and collaborate on shortlisting or ranking candidates. This improves efficiency and ensures a streamlined screening process.
\newline
Integration with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): The cloud database can be integrated with ATS software, allowing for seamless transfer of resume data between systems. This integration enables recruiters to manage the entire recruitment workflow, including resume screening, in a unified platform.
\newline
Data Security and Privacy: Cloud databases provide robust security measures to protect the sensitive resume data. Access controls, encryption, and regular backups are implemented to ensure data privacy and integrity. Compliance with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR, is essential to maintain confidentiality and protect candidate information.
\newline
By leveraging cloud databases, resume screening becomes more efficient, scalable, and collaborative. The centralized storage, parsing capabilities, search functionality, and automated screening algorithms enhance the speed and accuracy of the screening process. Recruiters can access and analyze resumes from anywhere, collaborate effectively, and make data-driven decisions for shortlisting candidates.
The problem which is given is same as mentioned in above all papers,The solution which is given for that is 
storing the datas on the cloud so that it can easily sort it out whenever the recruitment team needs. The drawback is that it can have a high formation of bugs,due to the use of internet usage.
\newline
\par In the paper[5]Resume screening based on experience, is fully based on the candidate experience certification process.
Resume screening based on experience involves evaluating and assessing job applicants' work history and relevant experience to determine their suitability for a particular role. Here's a brief explanation of how resume screening based on experience typically works:
\newline
Job Requirements: Recruiters establish the necessary qualifications and experience criteria for the position. This includes factors such as minimum years of experience, specific industry experience, job-specific skills, and relevant accomplishments.
\newline
Work History Evaluation: Recruiters carefully review the candidate's work history section in the resume to assess their past employment experiences. They analyze factors such as job titles, company names, job duration, and responsibilities to gain insights into the candidate's professional trajectory.
\newline
Relevance to the Role: Recruiters evaluate the relevance of the candidate's work experience to the requirements of the job. They assess whether the candidate has held positions that align with the job's responsibilities, industry, or desired skills. They also consider the depth and breadth of experience in the relevant field.
\newline
Chronological Order: Recruiters examine the chronological order of the candidate's work history. They look for any employment gaps or inconsistencies that may need clarification. They also assess the progressive nature of the candidate's career and the level of responsibility held in each role.
\newline
Accomplishments and Responsibilities: Recruiters focus on the candidate's accomplishments and responsibilities within their previous roles. They assess the candidate's impact, achievements, and contributions to projects, teams, or organizations. They look for specific examples that demonstrate relevant skills, such as leadership, problem-solving, or project management.
\newline
Quantifiable Results: Recruiters pay attention to any quantifiable results or metrics mentioned in the resume. These could include sales figures, revenue growth, cost savings, or other measurable outcomes that highlight the candidate's achievements and effectiveness in previous roles.
\newline
Career Progression: Recruiters assess the candidate's career progression and growth over time. They look for indications of increasing responsibility, promotions, or transitions to higher-level roles. A clear and upward trajectory can demonstrate the candidate's ability to take on challenges and grow professionally.
\newline
Industry Relevance: Recruiters consider the candidate's experience within the specific industry or related sectors. They evaluate whether the candidate has the necessary knowledge, familiarity with industry-specific processes, or understanding of relevant regulations.
\newline
Additional Factors: Recruiters also take into account other factors, such as the reputation of previous employers, the size of organizations the candidate has worked in, and any notable projects or clients they have been associated with.
\newline
Based on the evaluation of the candidate's experience, recruiters determine whether the candidate meets the required level of expertise and is likely to succeed in the role. Candidates with relevant, in-depth experience that closely matches the job requirements are typically given higher consideration during the resume screening process.
The problem is same as mentioned in all the above papers,The solution which is given to this paper is analyze based on eperiences of candidates,The major drwaback for this paper is that they will miss out the freshers and skilled peoples, who doesnt have any kind of experiences in any field.
\bigskip
\par In the paer[6],Resume screening based on AWS methodology,Here the Problem is having same as above mentioned all papers.
Resume screening using Amazon Web Services (AWS) involves leveraging AWS services and tools to enhance the resume screening process. Here's a brief explanation of how it can be implemented:
\newline
Data Storage and Management: AWS offers scalable and secure cloud storage solutions, such as Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) or Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service). Resumes can be stored in these services, ensuring easy accessibility, durability, and high availability.
\newline
Resume Parsing: AWS provides services like Amazon Textract or Amazon Comprehend, which can be used to extract structured data from resumes automatically. These services leverage machine learning algorithms to parse resumes and extract information such as candidate names, contact details, work experience, education, and skills. This parsing process saves time and eliminates manual data entry.
\newline
Resume Indexing and Search: AWS services like Amazon Elasticsearch or Amazon CloudSearch can be used to index the parsed resume data, making it searchable. Recruiters can query the indexed data using search queries or filters to find resumes based on specific criteria, such as skills, experience, or education.
\newline
Natural Language Processing (NLP): AWS offers NLP services like Amazon Comprehend or Amazon Lex, which can be used to analyze resume content. These services can extract key phrases, entities, or sentiments from resumes, helping recruiters gain deeper insights into the candidates' qualifications, accomplishments, and experience.
\newline
Automated Screening and Scoring: AWS allows the development and deployment of custom machine learning models using services like Amazon SageMaker. Recruiters can build models to automatically screen and score resumes based on predefined criteria. Machine learning algorithms can analyze the parsed resume data, compare it against job requirements, and assign scores or rankings to candidates based on their qualifications and relevance.
\newline
Cloud Computing Power: AWS provides scalable and powerful computing resources through services like Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) or AWS Lambda. These resources can be leveraged to process large volumes of resumes efficiently and perform resource-intensive tasks, such as running complex algorithms or conducting extensive data analysis.
\newline
Integration with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): AWS services can be integrated with existing ATS platforms, allowing seamless data transfer between systems. This integration ensures a smooth flow of resume data, including parsed information, scoring results, and other relevant details, to streamline the overall recruitment workflow.
\newline
Data Security and Compliance: AWS provides robust security features and compliance certifications, ensuring the protection and privacy of candidate data. Encryption, access controls, and data backup mechanisms help maintain data security and meet regulatory requirements.
\newline
By utilizing AWS services, resume screening processes can be enhanced with automation, scalability, and advanced analysis capabilities. This can result in improved efficiency, accurate candidate assessment, and a more streamlined recruitment process.
The solution which is given to the paper is that utilizing AWS method The drawback is that it only focusing the AWS data.

\section{Proposed System}
Resume Screening is the primary step in the hiring process. It evaluates the candidates' resumes and determines whether they are qualified for a role based on their education, skill sets, technical stuff, experience, and other information captured in their resume. To make it simple, it's a form of pattern that matches the job requirement and the candidate's qualifications based on their resume. It is a crucial step in the process of hiring. It is the step in which a decision is made to move the candidate to the next level or not. There are multiple processes to perform resume screening. Among all the processes, traditional resume or manual screening is the largest followed, even today. But usually, companies receive thousands of resumes for job applications, which consumes a lot of time and effort. In addition to this, many errors may arise due to human involvement. Multiple ways were introduced to cover all these cons to performing this resume screening process. Various technologies, including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, were involved in searching for solutions.
\newline
\par Resume screening software (also known as candidate screening software) helps recruitment and talent acquisition departments increase efficiency. It does that by organizing all the resumes received for each role so that the team is able to prioritize the candidates they want to invite to the interview process. Typically, a resume screening tool will determine the best applicants for a role based on keyword search results or answers to specific questions.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}


The candidates can only upload the resume which 
is in the format of PDF, into the website which we created with the help of the html. 
In to that created website the candidate need to upload the resume. Now the uploaded resume is taken as input process and it will performs it's further steps in next module.

		\label{ab}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\bigskip
Now the uploaded resume is taken as input that as mentioned earlier in the module 1, and the next phase of the project is to take the resume that has been uploaded and it reads and extract the text from the uploaded resume. Here they only take the pdf files. After extraction of the text, the resume is cleaned, which means clearing all kind of unnecessary texts such as commas, bracket and all sorts of special symbols. As the special symbols are removed we add @ symbol for extracting the E-mail id from resume. 
\newline Then a dictionary is added where there would be keywords. The key terms included in each area of this dictionary were obtained through a research of the most common key terms included in industrial and system engineering job postings. This dictionary can be customized to add/remove key terms according to hiring managers criteria.
\newline
So when the extracted text words matches the words of keyword then the scores are appended. With the scores a calculated a sorted data frame would be created. With the help of sorted data frame a pie chart would be created. 

\subsection{Module 3}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width = 13 cm]{m3.png}
		\caption{Architecture of Module 3}
		\label{ab}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\bigskip
The sorted data frame that has been already calculated in module 2 would be taken out to check the condition that the company required. The condition would be like: "if a candidates resume has a pass score in a particular slice of the pie chart then an automated mail would be send to the candidates". The pass score in particular slice is arranged by the company.

\subsubsection{Python Flask-Framework}
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that allows you to build web applications quickly and with minimal boilerplate code. It was developed by Armin Ronacher and released in 2010. Flask is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for web development.

Here are some key features and aspects of Flask:
\begin{enumerate}
  
\item  Microframework: Flask is considered a microframework because it focuses on simplicity and minimalism. It provides the core functionality needed for web development, such as routing, request handling, and template rendering, without imposing strict architectural patterns or adding unnecessary layers of abstraction. This lightweight approach gives developers more freedom to structure their applications according to their preferences.

\item  Routing and View Functions: Flask uses a decorator-based syntax to define routes and associate them with view functions. A route is a URL pattern that maps to a specific function. When a user accesses a particular URL, Flask invokes the associated view function to generate the response. This routing mechanism allows you to define different routes for various parts of your application and handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) on those routes.

\item Template Engine: Flask includes a template engine called Jinja2, which enables you to generate HTML dynamically. Jinja2 allows you to separate the presentation logic from the application's business logic by defining templates with placeholders (variables) and control structures (loops, conditionals). You can pass data from your views to templates to render dynamic content.

\item  HTTP Request and Response Handling: Flask provides an easy-to-use API for handling HTTP requests and generating responses. You can access request data, such as form input, query parameters, and headers, using Flask's request object. Likewise, you can generate responses with different content types (HTML, JSON, etc.) using Flask's response object or by returning values directly from view functions.

\item  Extensions and Modularity: Flask follows a "micro but expandable" philosophy. While it provides a minimal core, you can extend its functionality using various Flask extensions. These extensions add extra features like database integration, authentication, form validation, and more. Flask extensions are developed by the community and can be easily integrated into your Flask applications.

\item  Development Server and Debugging: Flask includes a built-in development server that simplifies the testing and debugging process. It automatically reloads the server when you modify your code, allowing you to see the changes immediately. Additionally, Flask provides a robust error handling mechanism that displays detailed error messages and a debugger to help identify and fix issues during development.

\item Integration with Other Technologies: Flask seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries and tools, making it a versatile choice for web development. You can easily use Flask with popular database systems like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, and integrate it with ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) such as SQLAlchemy. Flask can also work well with front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build single-page applications (SPAs).
  
\end{enumerate}
Flask's simplicity and flexibility make it a great option for small to medium-sized web applications, RESTful APIs, prototypes, and personal projects. It provides a solid foundation for web development in Python and allows developers to focus on their application's specific requirements without unnecessary complexity.

\subsection{HTML}
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It defines the elements and tags that structure the information displayed in a browser. Basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web. HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link.

There is a range of HTML tags, they help you to design your web page. There are four required tags in HTML. These are html, title, head and body. The table below shows you the opening and closing tag, a description and an example.

There are three categories of HTML: transitional, strict, and frameset. Transitional is the most common type of HTML while the strict type of HTML is meant to return rules to HTML and make it more reliable. Frameset allows Web developers to create a mosaic of HTML documents and a menu system. It's the way web pages and email templates are coded so that text is formatted and images are added. Plain Text is regular text, with no formatting options such as bold, italics, underlines, or special layout options. HTML works alongside CSS and JavaScript to build interactive and visually appealing websites. Here's an overview of HTML:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Document Structure: HTML documents are structured using a hierarchical format called the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents elements as nodes in a tree-like structure. An HTML document starts with the <html> tag and contains a head section (<head>) for metadata and a body section (<body>) for the visible content of the page.

\item Elements and Tags: HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. They are defined using tags, enclosed in angle brackets (<>). Tags are composed of an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>), where the content resides. Some elements, known as empty elements, do not require a closing tag and are self-closing (<tag />). Examples of common HTML elements include headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.), paragraphs (<p>), links (<a>), images (<img>), lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>), and more.

\item Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about an element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value (name="value"). Attributes define properties like the source of an image, the target of a link, the size of an input field, and more. Examples of attributes include src, href, class, id, alt, style, and data-* attributes.

\item Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements that convey the meaning and structure of the content more accurately. These elements include <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, and more. Semantic elements provide better accessibility, improve search engine optimization (SEO), and help developers structure web pages in a more meaningful way.

\item Hyperlinks: HTML allows the creation of hyperlinks using the <a> (anchor) element. The href attribute specifies the URL to which the link points. Hyperlinks can be used to navigate within the same page, link to other pages, or link to external resources like images, documents, or videos. Additionally, HTML provides the ability to open links in a new window or tab using the target attribute.

\item Lists: HTML supports ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>) lists. List items are defined using the <li> element, which is placed inside either an <ol> or <ul> element. Ordered lists display items with a numbering sequence, while unordered lists display items with bullet points. Nested lists can also be created by placing lists within lists.

\item Forms: HTML provides form elements (<form>, <input>, <textarea>, etc.) for capturing user input. Forms allow users to submit data to a server for processing. Various input types (text, email, password, checkbox, radio, etc.) and attributes (required, placeholder, disabled, etc.) can be used to define the behavior and appearance of form elements.

\item Multimedia: HTML supports the inclusion of multimedia content on web pages. The <img> element is used to display images, while the <audio> and <video> elements are used to embed audio and video files, respectively. These elements support different attributes for controlling playback, size, and alternative content.

\item Tables: HTML tables (<table>, <tr>, <td>) are used to organize data into rows and columns. Tables can be styled using CSS to enhance their appearance and improve readability. Additionally, HTML provides elements like <th> for table headers and attributes like colspan and rowspan for merging cells.
\end{enumerate}
HTML is continually evolving, with new versions introducing additional features and elements. It provides the foundation for web development, allowing developers to structure and present content in a standardized manner across different browsers and devices.

\subsection{CSS}
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology used for styling and formatting web documents. It describes how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page, including their layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. 
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. 
CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
\newline
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium.
There are 3 distinct methods for styling in CSS, Local style, Page-Level style, and External Styles. Each level of styling is given a different hierarchical priority (when to apply) and is used for different reasons. The 3 methods are further grouped into two categories. Namely Internal CSS and External CSS.
In CSS, a class is a group of elements that are the same or similar. You can have as many elements as you want in a class. And each element can be the member of multiple classes. Every class has CSS attributes (like color and font-size) that are specific to that class.
CSS works alongside HTML and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive web pages. Here's an overview of CSS:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Separation of Style and Structure: CSS enables the separation of a web page's content (HTML structure) from its presentation (styling). This separation allows developers to define styles independently and apply them consistently across multiple web pages. It promotes clean code, easy maintenance, and the ability to update the visual appearance of a website without modifying the underlying HTML structure.

  \item Selectors and Declarations: CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styling rules. Selectors can be based on element types (e.g., h1, p), class names (e.g., .container, .highlighted), IDs (e.g., header, sidebar), and more. Once a selector is defined, you can specify one or more declarations, which consist of a property and a value. For example, you can set the color property to red, the font-size property to 16 pixels, or the background-image property to a specific image URL.

  \item Style Inheritance and Specificity: CSS employs a cascading nature, where styles can be inherited from parent elements and overridden by more specific rules. This cascading behavior allows for efficient and modular style definitions. However, when multiple conflicting styles are applied to the same element, CSS uses a specificity calculation to determine which style takes precedence.

  \item Layout and Positioning: CSS provides various layout and positioning options to control the arrangement of elements on a web page. These include properties like display (e.g., block, inline, flex), position (e.g., static, relative, absolute), float, margin, padding, and more. With these properties, you can create responsive designs, align elements, create columns, and control the flow of content.

  \item Responsive Design: CSS plays a crucial role in creating responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Using CSS media queries, developers can define different styles based on the screen width, height, or other device-specific features. This allows the website layout and appearance to adjust dynamically, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

  \item Animations and Transitions: CSS provides support for animations and transitions, allowing developers to create engaging and interactive user experiences. With keyframes and animation properties, elements can move, change size, fade in/out, or perform other dynamic effects. Transitions enable smooth property changes over time, such as gradual color shifts or smooth transitions between layout states.

  \item Selectors and Pseudo-Classes: CSS offers a wide range of selectors to target specific elements or groups of elements. Additionally, pseudo-classes provide a way to target elements based on their state or position within the document. Examples of pseudo-classes include :hover, :active, :first-child, :nth-child(), and many more. These selectors and pseudo-classes enhance the control and interactivity of web pages.

  \item CSS Frameworks: To expedite web development and ensure consistent styling, developers often use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Bulma. These frameworks provide pre-designed CSS components, grids, and stylesheets that can be easily integrated into a project, simplifying the styling process and ensuring a cohesive visual design.
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip
CSS is continuously evolving, and new features and enhancements are regularly introduced to the language. With CSS, developers have powerful tools to control the presentation and styling of web pages.

\chapter{IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION}



%When implementing MIRNet for dark image enhancement, the following steps are typically involved:
%\begin{enumerate}
 %\item  Dataset Preparation: A dataset of low-light or dark images is collected for training the MIRNet model. The dataset should include pairs of input dark images and corresponding ground truth images that are properly exposed or enhanced.

 %\item  Network Architecture: The MIRNet architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers and residual blocks. It utilizes a multi-scale approach to capture both global and local image details. The network is designed to learn the mapping function between the low-light input images and their enhanced versions.

 %\item  Training: The MIRNet model is trained using the collected dataset. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the enhanced output images and the corresponding ground truth images. This is typically done by minimizing a loss function such as mean squared error (MSE) or perceptual loss.

 %\item  Data Augmentation: To improve the model's robustness and generalization, data augmentation techniques like random cropping, rotation, flipping, and adding noise may be applied to the training dataset. These augmentations help the model learn to handle different lighting conditions and variations in real-world images.

 %\item  Post-processing: After the MIRNet model produces an enhanced output image, post-processing techniques can be applied to further refine the results. These techniques may include denoising filters, histogram equalization, or tone mapping to improve contrast and color balance.

 %\item  Deployment: Once the MIRNet model is trained and tested, it can be deployed to enhance dark images in real-time or in batch processing. The model takes a low-light image as input and produces an enhanced image as output, effectively improving its brightness, reducing noise, and enhancing its visual quality.

%Dark image enhancement is an important task in computer vision, aiming to improve the visibility and quality of images captured in low-light conditions. MIRNet (Multi-scale Residual Network) is a deep learning-based method that has shown promising results in dark image enhancement. Here's a comparative study between MIRNet and some other popular methods for dark image enhancement:

%\subsection{Retinex-based Methods}
%Retinex-based methods aim to enhance the image by separating the reflectance and illumination components. Traditional Retinex algorithms, such as Single-scale Retinex (SSR) and Multi-scale Retinex (MSR), have been widely used. These methods suffer from issues like color distortion, halo artifacts, and over-enhancement in some cases.

%Comparative Study:
%MIRNet improves upon Retinex-based methods by leveraging deep learning techniques to learn more robust and effective features. It outperforms traditional Retinex algorithms by reducing color distortion, halo artifacts, and preserving more details in the enhanced images.

%\subsection{Histogram Equalization} 
%Histogram equalization is a simple and widely used method for enhancing the contrast of an image. It redistributes the pixel intensities to span the entire dynamic range. However, it may lead to over-enhancement and produce unnatural-looking images.

%\subsection{Deep Learning-based Methods}
%Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for dark image enhancement, including CNN-based models like EnhanceNet and LIME, and GAN-based models like Pix2Pix and CycleGAN.

%Comparative Study:
%MIRNet demonstrates competitive performance compared to these deep learning-based methods. It benefits from the multi-scale residual architecture, which captures both global and local information effectively. MIRNet achieves better image enhancement by leveraging a hierarchical fusion strategy and reducing artifacts commonly present in GAN-based methods.

%\subsection{ Low-light Image Enhancement Network (LIME)}
%LIME is a deep learning-based method specifically designed for low-light image enhancement. It employs an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections to enhance the details and contrast in dark images.

%Comparative Study:
%MIRNet outperforms LIME by utilizing multi-scale residual blocks that effectively capture hierarchical features. MIRNet provides superior results by preserving more details, reducing noise, and enhancing the overall brightness and contrast.

%It's worth noting that the performance of different methods can vary depending on the specific dataset and evaluation metrics used. While this comparative study provides a general overview, it's recommended to consult the original research papers for more detailed insights and performance comparisons on specific benchmark datasets.

\chapter{ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES}
\section{Advantages}
\begin{enumerate}

\item  Easy uploading to multiple job-search sites and social media so that candidates far and wide will know you are hiring:\\
Social media should not be underestimated in the hiring process.

\item Scientific and psychometric assessments to ensure only quality candidates make the cut:\\
Most resume screening software only looks for keywords: candidate screening software examines not just whether they can do the job, but how they will do it and apply their values, personal traits, and behaviours to their duties.

\item Customized interviews:\\
A staff accountant needs different interview questions than an administrative assistant to determine if they’re truly a good fit, and each company offers a different product or service so interviews are not one size fits all. As an added bonus, you or your hiring managers don’t need to spend time making up questions to ask.

\item Eliminate costly screening calls:\\
Taking notes on just one candidate can take up to two hours of your or your employees’ valuable time. A streamlined screening solution will make this process much easier.

\item Seamlessly integrate with in-house talent management solutions"\\
The days of cumbersome employee files and performance evaluations are over, and candidate screening software can be a gateway for improving your existing talent management.

\item Cut down on time sitting through interviews:\\
Candidate screening software sorts through the available talent ahead of time and ensuring they have the necessary experience and skills for the job, you won’t waste time interviewing unsuitable candidates and can shorten interviews with the best candidates.

\item Decrease turnover rates:\\
Candidates who have not just the right skills and experience but also the personal values, traits, and methods that gel with your company’s culture will be less likely to seek opportunities elsewhere than candidates who are skilled but simply go through the motions at your workplace.

\item Make more confident hiring decisions:\\
Interviews and resumes aren’t enough to really determine who is the best fit for your business. Using a scientific-based approach to screen candidates’ problem-solving and interpersonal skills, values, and traits will lend you more confidence to making the right hiring decisions.

\item Save time sorting through resumes:\\
You’ll get inundated with job seekers regardless of the position, and sorting through resumes can take days.

\item Convenient dashboard for all communications and relevant documents:\\
Searching through email and files to find a candidate’s resume, application, cover letter, and other documents can create a time-consuming mess, candidate sorting software helps keep all communications and documents received from candidates in one convenient location.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Disadvantages}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Keywords are Created Based on A Previous Job Description:\\
Cultivating the best match between a company and a prospective hire is not based on job descriptions and criteria for the last person who worked the job. Companies should be looking for someone to step into the position that can make it better. Resume screening programs cannot find that person based on keywords constructed from previous job descriptions.

\item The Application Process is Off-Putting:\\
When you’re facing a shortage of qualified candidates that will add value to your company, is your first thought, “Let me make the application process as tedious and repellant as possible?” Resume screeners are built on a foundation of faulty logic. Resume screening was created to weed out unsuitable candidates instead of recruiting suitable ones.

\item Applicants Can Work the System:\\
A brief Google search pulls up over 24,000 search results for how to beat a resume screener. Applicants have caught onto the process of screening based on keywords and will stuff their resumes full of them to move onto the next stage of the hiring process. This means that the applicants who are usually approved by resume screeners know how to use keywords appropriately, but that does not necessarily make them the best person for the position. A candidate with better skills might be left in the slush pile.

\end{enumerate}


\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS}
\section{Conclusion}

Presently, we have seen the technology reaching new heights than ever ahead. But each association has a different way of working but for this they need people who have a specific skill set. Selection of the candidate is done on the base of seeing the skill set mentioned in the person's capsule who is applying at the organization. 
\newline
\par Technology is making the job search process easier and harder. Larger pools of applicants and limited opportunities force candidates to write outstanding resumes capable of defeating the “bots”. It is highly recommended for candidates to optimize their resumes keywords to represent their soft and hard skills and avoid including buzzwords. It is crucial for candidates to know how resume screening systems work to beat them and get their resumes to be viewed by a talent acquisition professional.
\newline
\par Resume screening is one of the most critical step in the recruitment cycle. It makes screening easier for the recruiters. Generally, resumes are sorted manually but, going through the resumes of these people manually is extremely time- consuming and lower effective as there are chances of human intervention error. Hence, the project designs a software which will sort all the resumes according to the demand of the company and reduce the working time for further recruitment process.

\par The algorithm will work in such a way that when a resume is to be scanned it will search only for the words according to the demand by the company and sort it accordingly. The required resume is shortlisted and the rest are auto rejected by the model. This will give high effectiveness compared to the manual sorting and give produce good results. This will lots of time and work of recruiters.


\section{Future Enhancements}
A well-structured resume clearly highlights your most attractive skills and experience to potential employers. This allows them to move forward with the best candidate. It's important to make sure your most recent skills and experiences are reflected in your resume for this reason.
\newline
\par Future work for this system  includes mining social networking data  (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn,  GitHub profiles) of  the candidates and utilising  this social behaviour information in combination with resume content to make even  more  improved  recommendations.  
\newline 
\par Another  possibility  is  using  a collaborative  filtering  based  approach  that  can  match  the  current applicant  with  a  job  according  to  how  well  other  similar  candidates (neighbours) are rated for it. Another scope of future work lies in the use of Latent Semantic Analysis (Berry, M., 2001) in the calculation of semantic similarity between the documents and then comparing it with the results of the term frequency based similarity approach.
\newline
\par Scoring can be done based on weights given to each parameters. Higher weights can be given to more relevant parameters. The relevancy of the parameters can be measured using past recruitment trends.
\newline
\par Personality analysis can be done of the shortlisted candidates using social media information provided in the resumes. this analysis will help to judge whether the candidate's personality as per his/her social life matches the job requirements.
\newline
\par The future versions of this application will include more types of resumes or templates, and it will accept input in any extended format  such as .pdf or .docx, so that the object detection range can be expanded. 
Additionally, we work to manage job descriptions that require more evaluation criteria, such as soft skills or qualifications relevant to a certain industry. More complex evaluation criteria may be added in the future to increase the accuracy of candidate matching.
\newline
\par These potential future enhancements can contribute to further advancements in resume screening. By addressing specific challenges and incorporating user feedback, the model can continue to evolve and deliver more accurate, and adaptable results in the future.
